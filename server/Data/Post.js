        title:"Redux for Beginners â€“ Learn Redux with Code Examples",
        message:"Redux can be confusing for beginner React developers to understand. There are a lot of concepts you need to know to use it properly, like reducers, actions, store, pure functions, immutability, and much more But every React developer should know the basics of how to work with Redux since industry projects often use Redux to manage larger projects.So in this article, we'll explore the basics of Redux and how to use it.> What Is Redux?</br> Redux is a state management library that helps to better manage state in the application.Redux library is not specific to React. It's a library that you can use in any other library or framework like Angular, Vue and even vanilla JavaScript.But Redux is mostly used when working with React.Redux provides a single store that we can use to manage a large amount of data.",

        title:"How Truthy and Falsy Values in JavaScript Work",
        message:"> Truthy and falsy values are two important concepts for JavaScript developers to understand. In this tutorial, you will learn about what truthy and falsy values in JavaScript are and how they work. You will also learn how to convert values to Boolean with Boolean() constructor and NOT NOT operator, and why avoid new Boolean.As you probably already know Boolean, true and false, is one of the primitive data types that exist in JavaScript. Then, there are other primitive values such as strings, numbers, BigInt, null, undefined and symbols. Aside to these, there are objects. Objects also include arrays. However, there is more than that.All these primitive data types also have Boolean representation. What this means is that JavaScript can take each of these data types, their values, and evaluate them as Boolean. JavaScript can convert their vales to Boolean, either true or false. Which Boolean will it be depends on the data type you are working with.",
